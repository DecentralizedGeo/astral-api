# Astral Protocol API Documentation

Welcome to the Astral Protocol API documentation. This API provides access to location proof attestations across multiple blockchains, allowing developers to query, validate, and work with geographic location data that has been verified on the blockchain.

## What is Astral Protocol?

Astral Protocol is a system for creating, storing, and verifying location proofs on the blockchain. These proofs are stored as attestations using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and can be queried through this API.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Query location proofs from Arbitrum, Base, Celo, and Sepolia
- **Spatial Queries**: Find location proofs within specific geographic areas
- **Real-Time Syncing**: Automatic synchronization with blockchain data
- **Revocation Checking**: Verify if location proofs have been revoked
- **GeoJSON Support**: Work with standard GeoJSON location data

## API Overview

The Astral API is a RESTful API that provides endpoints for:

1. Querying location proofs with various filters
2. Retrieving specific location proofs by their unique identifier
3. Getting statistics about available location proofs
4. Triggering and monitoring blockchain synchronization
5. Checking the status of the API and sync process

## Getting Started

To start using the Astral API:

1. Check out the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md) for a quick introduction
2. Read the [API Reference](./api-reference.md) for detailed endpoint information
3. Learn about [Spatial Queries](./spatial-queries.md) for geographic filtering

## Example Use Cases

The Astral API enables numerous applications, including:

- **Supply Chain Verification**: Track and verify the geographic journey of goods
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Record and verify location data for environmental observations
- **Decentralized Mapping**: Build maps with verified location data
- **Proof-of-Presence**: Verify that someone or something was at a specific location
- **Geospatial Data Markets**: Create marketplaces for verified location data
- **Gaming**: Enable location-based gameplay with verifiable locations
