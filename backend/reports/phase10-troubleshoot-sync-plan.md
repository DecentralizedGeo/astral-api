# Phase 10: Troubleshoot Syncing Issues

## Overview

This document outlines a detailed plan for investigating and resolving issues with the Astral API's automatic synchronization functionality. Currently, the cron job for syncing attestations does not appear to be working as expected, despite being correctly configured in Vercel.

## Investigation Plan

### 1. Verify Cron Configuration

- [x] Check `vercel.json` to confirm cron job is properly configured
  - Cron job is configured to run every 15 minutes at path `/api/cron/sync`

### 2. Examine Logs and Monitoring

1. [ ] Check Vercel logs for cron execution
   - Review Function Logs in Vercel dashboard for `/api/cron/sync` endpoint
   - Look for error messages or timeouts
   - Verify that the cron job is being triggered as scheduled

2. [ ] Check application logs
   - Look for any errors related to the sync process
   - Check for any warnings or issues in the worker initialization

### 3. Endpoint Testing

1. [ ] Test cron endpoint manually
   - Make a direct POST request to `/api/cron/sync` endpoint
   - Examine the response and logs
   - Verify that the worker runs as expected when manually triggered

2. [ ] Test sync functionality components
   - Verify EAS service can connect to EAS indexers
   - Test database connectivity for storing attestations
   - Validate chain configuration settings

### 4. Code Review

1. [ ] Review `eas-worker.ts` for potential issues
   - Check initialization logic
   - Review error handling and retries
   - Examine the process chain methods

2. [ ] Review `sync.ts` cron handler
   - Verify proper error handling
   - Check for potential timeout issues
   - Ensure all chains are being processed

3. [ ] Examine database services
   - Check for connection issues or timeouts
   - Verify transaction handling and concurrency

### 5. Environment and Configuration

1. [ ] Verify environment variables
   - Check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel
   - Verify EAS indexer URLs are correct and accessible
   - Confirm database connection strings and credentials

2. [ ] Check for service limits
   - Verify if any API rate limits are being hit
   - Check database connection pool limits
   - Examine Vercel function execution limits (timeout, memory)

## Implementation Plan

Based on findings from the investigation, implement fixes in the following order:

### 1. Configuration Fixes

- [ ] Update environment variables if needed
- [ ] Adjust timeout settings if required
- [ ] Fix any incorrect URLs or endpoints

### 2. Code Improvements

- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement more robust retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add better instrumentation for debugging

### 3. Infrastructure Changes

- [ ] Adjust resource allocation if needed
- [ ] Consider separating sync process from API for better resource management
- [ ] Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting

### 4. Testing and Verification

- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests for the sync functionality
- [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard for sync operations
- [ ] Set up alerts for sync failures

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing the fixes, we expect:

1. Reliable and consistent execution of the sync process every 15 minutes
2. Complete logging of sync activities, including success/failure status
3. Proper error handling and recovery from transient failures
4. Clear monitoring and visibility into the sync process status

## Progress Tracking
